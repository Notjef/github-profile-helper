# Snake Animation on GitHub Profile

This animation shows the "snake" eating your contributions on the GitHub contributions grid. 🐍  

---

## How to use

1. Copy the following code:

```html
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/notjef/notjef/output/snake.svg" alt="Snake animation" />

2.	Replace notjef/notjef with your own GitHub username twice.
	•	The first notjef is the username.
	•	The second notjef is also the username, because the snake workflow generates the file in the same repo.

  👉 Example if your username is octocat:
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/octocat/octocat/output/snake.svg" alt="Snake animation" />
