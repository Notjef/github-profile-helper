# Tutorial: How to Use GIFs in Your README with Imgur

GIFs make your profile and repositories more dynamic and engaging.  
Here’s a simple step-by-step guide to add a GIF using *Imgur*:

---

## 1. Host your GIF
- Go to [Imgur](https://imgur.com)  
- Upload your GIF  
- Right-click on the GIF and copy the *direct link* (it should end with .gif).

Example of a direct link: https://imgur.com/66oMD7P.gif

---

## 2. Add it to your README
Use the <img> tag inside your README.md file.  
Example:

```html
<img align="right" alt="My gif" height="600px" src="https://imgur.com/66oMD7P.gif" />

3. Customize
	•	align=“right” → sets the position of the GIF (right, left, or remove it).
	•	height=“600px” → sets the size (adjust as needed).
	•	alt=“My gif” → alternative text (shows if the GIF doesn’t load).
	•	src=”…” → paste your direct GIF link here.

⸻

✨ Tip: just replace the direct link in the src attribute with your own GIF.
